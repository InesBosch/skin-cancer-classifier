# Skin Cancer Classifer Using Dermoscopic Images of Pigmented Lesions
## Project Motivation
Skin cancer is the 19th most common form of cancer for humans [1]. As with most forms of cancer, early detection and treatment of skin cancer can have life-altering results. Skin cancer is diagnosed through a skin biopsy that involves a careful examination of the patientâ€™s moles, skin lesions and overall skin tone [2]. This process can be lengthy, costly and complex, and it typically requires a high level of technical skill and experience. 

Our project goal was to design  a classifier that is able to classify dermatoscopic images of skin lesions as being malignant or benign. Machine learning would be of appropriate use in this field as a classifier trained with images of skin cancer lesions would greatly aid in this early detection.  Our design allows those without formal medical training to easily determine if a skin lesion/mole is cancerous by simply providing an image of the lesion.
